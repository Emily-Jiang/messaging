## Minutes

* (Ondro) EE Messaging 3.1 plan as was approved recently didn’t have high goals, maybe we can add new features, but we aim here to discuss longer plans for EE Messaging
* (Clebert) JMS is more than 20 years long and has a lot of legacy, which isn’t needed anymore and there’s a lot of usecases where it’s complicated or not possible to use it in the current state
* (Reza) Presented a [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7XfC-zNend0aT8PKbcOTbKx_9tXPrhmolBI9iPr4BE/edit?usp=sharing) that triages existing issues into categories and priorities
* (Ondro) An idea: old API should be separated or maybe even create a new messaging spec side by side with the old spec
* (David) it makes sense to separate the old API and and make it optional, maybe even create a “lite” profile with only the new API
* (David and Clebert) The new API should be simple and allow that semantics are up to the implementation
* (Ondro) We should revisit MicroProfile Messaging because they tried to achieve a similar goal
* (David) it seems we have a consensus
* (Reza) If there’s a consensus, MS (Azure Service Bus team) is interested to join and collaborate
* (Ivar) To confirm a consensus, there should be a vote
* (David) if we leave semantics to the implementations then it’s possible to find a good trade-off between speed and reliability by choosing an appropriate implementation
* (David) We should create a new issue to cover the “lite” profile or reuse existing related issues - optional/relaxed delivery semantics and guarantees, etc.
* Some existing related issues
  * [New "relaxed message order" option (#91)](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/messaging/issues/91)
  * [fit well for JMS over Kafka (#210)](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/messaging/issues/210)
* (David) Let’s have an issue for each specific guarantee to relax them or make them optional
* (David) Presented a proposed structure for the [messaging-propsals](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/messaging-propsals) repository, with a structure in the README file for each proposal, for example [README for JSON-B proposal](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/messaging-propsals/tree/master/jsonb-messages/proposal1)
